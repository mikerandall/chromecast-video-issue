This repo is to reproduce a bug I am seeing in a Chromecast receiver application.

Typically, when the application starts up, I would immediately connect to the CC using
the Media Manager. The user is given a chance to browse different "instructor led videos"
and play them on the chromecast.

Because I am unable to connect to the CC through this page, I have no idea if this test
accurately replicates the issue. But I'm pretty certain this is what is causing the error.

Having said that, this is will probably reproduce the error.

1. From the first page, click to the movements page.
2. Click the "Load Next Video" button until the brain freeze occurs.
3. Profit?

Let me know if you have any questions.
