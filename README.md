This repo is to reproduce a bug I am seeing in a Chromecast receiver application.

Typically, when the application starts up, I would immediately connect to the CC using
the Media Manager. The user is given a chance to browse different "instructor led videos"
and play them on the chromecast.

Because I am unable to connect to the CC through this page, I have no idea if this test
accurately replicates the issue. But I'm pretty certain this is what is causing the error.
